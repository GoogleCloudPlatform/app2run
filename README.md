  translate                   Translate an app.yaml to migrate to Cloud Run.
```
### Testing CLI
In the application source code folder with app.yaml (if you don't already have an App Engine app, you could also use one of the [e2e test apps in App Egnine Flex](http://google3/apphosting/flex/e2e/apps/)), run the `list-incompatible-features` command to identify incompatible features:
```
$ app2run list-incompatible-features
```
Example output:
```
summary:
  major: 3
incompatible_features:
- path: runtime_config.python_version
  reason: 4 is not a known value for runtime_config.python_version.
  severity: unknown
- path: network.forwarded_ports
  reason: Cloud Run does not support port forwarding. No clients can connect to the
    app using the forwarded ports.
  severity: major
- path: resources.memory_gb
  reason: Cloud Run supports max 32Gi of memory.
  severity: major
```

Test the `translate` command, run:
```
$ app2run translate
```
Example output:
```
